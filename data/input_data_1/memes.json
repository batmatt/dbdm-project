Johnson often did the expression through his wrestling and movie career (example photographs and video shown below).",

On February 19th, 2021, Johnson posted a TikTok[4] video set to \"Ice Ice Baby\" by Vanilla Ice in which he does the expression.

For example, when used with Whomst, a person who uses \"who\" will be shown with the smallest brain, while a person who uses the most ridiculous variation, i.e. \"whomst'd've\", will be shown with the largest brain."

Between January and March in 2016, the term \"drakeposting\" was mentioned in hundreds of independently archived discussion threads across 4chan.[9][10][11][12][13][14]",
        "As a result of its growing presence on 4chan imageboards, the \"drakeposting\" phenomenon has prompted a number of tangential discussion threads on Sheeky Forum, a 4chan-affiliated community and archive site, as well as on Reddit's /r/4chan section. On January 30th, Sheeky Forum user TechHater[15] asked about the popularity of \"drakeposting\" on the site in a Q&A thread.[4] On February 2nd, Redditor Bobbistef[18] mentioned \"drakeposting\" in response to an /r/4chan thread introducing the arrival of a new exploitable meme based on the character Pacha from Disney‚Äòs 2000 animated buddy comedy film The Emperor's New Groove . On February 22nd, Sheeky Forum user Need_TLC[17] started a survey asking other forum members' favorite Drake songs in a thread titled \"Now that Drake is officially vidya related Sheeky Forums culture, what is your favorite Drake song?\""

That Feel Guy, Smug Frog is shown to be abusive or antagonistic towards him.",

The player must choose whether to accept the statement as truthful (\"Truth\"), express doubt of the witness' statement (\"Doubt\"), or accuse the witness of lying (\"Lie\"). An image of Phelps' face looking disbelieving accompanied by the \"Doubt\" prompt became the reaction image (shown below, left).

For example, a post from Tumblr user loatheoflaughing about Fallout 4 expressed doubt that the game would feature no loading times as promised, turning into a thread[5] with several Coaxed Into a Snafu variations (shown below). The post gained over 28,000 notes.",

        "In a scene where Wosniak is describing his prior investigations, he flashes back to a scene where he believes he successfully masqueraded as a high school student, parodying the TV show 21 Jump Street.[12] Buscemi, a 55-year-old at the time the episode aired, approaches a group of high school teens dress as a \"one of them.\" However, his grizzled appearance in contrast with his silly approximation of high school attire, which includes a backwards hat, a skateboard worn over his shoulder and a t-shirt that reads \"Music Band\" in the style of the classic AC/DC logo, is indicative of his poor and obvious disguise. As he approaches, he says, \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" The catchphrase has since come to represent all egregious attempts at appealing to subcultures.",

Beginning in 2004, the joke spawned hundreds of parody sites featuring the soundbite of Admiral Ackbar's quote on YTMND, with the most notable instance uploaded by user MultiKoopa on June 2nd, 2005, which has garnered more than 313,000 views (as of April 2016). Around the same time, shortly after the launch of the imageboard community 4chan, the phrase became closely associated with traps, a slang term for a photograph of a model or illustration of an anime character wherein the gender of the subject seems to be ambiguous or androgynous in appearance. Following the launch of YouTube in 2005, more than a thousand fan-made videos that prominently feature or parody Admiral Ackbar's line and the extended dialogue were uploaded to the video sharing site.

So, different from the previous titles, there were many comic-like depictions in its storylines, characters and mobile suits designs. It often became the subject of controversy among existing Gundam fans, and the anime finally didn't achieve enough commercial success as a Gundam title.",
        "In that context, the remark was uttered by Iwark Bria („Ç§„ÉØ„Éº„ÇØ„Éª„Éñ„É©„Ç§„Ç¢) in the 6th episode aired on November 13th, 2011. In the scene, this middle-aged guy with oddly short fat body (shown above) told the protagonists, Flit and Emily, with a detached tone about their hard life forced by pointless ideologies of people on topside in their space colony. Shortly after, he suddenly uttered the remark along with saturated linework.",

Furthermore, his ridiculousness was so much emphasized by his foolhardy attack to battle mobile suits by unstylish work mobile suit \"Desperado\"."

That famous line \"We're being forced to‚Ä¶\" repeatedly appears from the beginning of its lyrics (shown below, right).",

This funny invention was reported by Kotaku JAPAN on January 22nd, 2012.[6] Besides, Japanese adult video game Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai![7] released in January 2012 included a homage to Iwark's remark and that (shown below, right).",

          "In 2005, a poster on the Straight Dope forums[3] noted that the slow clap first appeared on film in the 1941 film Citizen Kane. During the film, Orson Welles' character Charles Kane is attempting to start a round of applause for his wife after a poorly received opera performance, but he is the only person clapping (shown below). Though Kane's intention was to cheer on his wife, it came off as a person fiercely applauding a dreadful display. The GIF has since become one of the most well-known clapping GIFs online and has been used since as early as November 2007.[32]",

In February 2006, a posted on the FS Passengers forum[10] inquired if anyone had heard a slow clap on a flight with a poor landing before. In 2008, a clip of Heath Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight sarcastically clapping at the news that James Gordon (Gary Oldman) would be named Police Commissioner the following day. While Ledger is shown clapping at a normal speed in the film, the footage was slowed down in trailers for dramatic effect.[11]",

I would pretend that I was dimension-hopping.\"",
          "Mirkin also explained that the scene is also mistakenly considered a reference to the 1991 science fiction action film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. This is due to the fact that Homer's movement resembles the film's character the T-1000, a shapeshifting robot that can move through prison walls in a similar fashion. Additionally, an \"almost shot-for-shot Terminator homage that immediately follows [the scene], in which Homer robotically chases down Ned‚Äôs sputtering Geo as the Flanders family desperately tries to escape his affections.\"",

        "In 1958, comedian Bob Hope told a variation of the joke, according to an April 7th, 1958 issue of Time.[1] They write:",
        "Ukrainian-born American comedian Yakov Smirnoff grew in popularity in the 1980s with an act that used wordplay to satirize the differences between his life in the United States of America and his old life in what was then part of the Russian-led Soviet Union (example below). One style of joke, in particular, that he told was known as the Russian Reversal, or simply referred to as, \"In Soviet Russia‚Ä¶\"",
        "",
        "Over time, the joke became a cultural reference uttered on television and cartoons, usually as a parody of Smirnoff, who had become closely associated with the form. On June 27th, 2000, the Family Guy episode \"There's Something About Paulie\" aired in the United States.[2] In the episode, the character Peter shows off his car's global positioning system, which has a Yakov Smirnoff voice. It says, \"In Soviet Russia, car drives you! Turn right at fork in road. In Soviet Russia, road forks you!\" (video below).",
        "",
        "Two years laterOn February 24th, 2002, the King of the Hill episode \"The Bluegrass Is Always Greener,\" the character meets Smirnoff in his home Branson, Missouri. Bobby performs a variation of the Russian Reversal. he says, \" In America, you put 'In God We Trust' on your money. In Russia, we have no money!\"[3]",
        "In 2002, The Simpsons [4] also referenced Yakov Smirnoff's Russian Reversal in the March 10th, 2002 episode \"Old Man and the Key.\" In the episode, Abe Simpson and his girlfriend Zelda visit Branson, Missouri where they see a Yakov Smirnoff comedy review. Smirnoff, who guest stars on the episode, subverts the format by reciting a variation without affectation. He says, \"In Russia, stage is for performers only.\"",
        "Throughout the 2000s, the snowclone was adopted in various meme formats, including Demotivational Posters, which take advantage of the forms set-up-punchline template (examples below).",

        "On January 20th, 2004, Apple Insider user SpcMs[2] started a thread[1] asking where he could download RAM for his computer. He claimed his computer was low on memory and he wanted to illegally acquire more. Within three minutes, another user responded saying that it cannot be downloaded as RAM is a physical thing, providing two links to retail websites to purchase additional RAM.",

Fifteen days later, a thread directly copied from Overclockers was posted on the eBaum‚Äôs World Forum.[4] Over the next two years, dubious questions about how or where to download RAM continued to surface on a wide range of computer and gaming-related forums including Tech Support Forum[5], Tom‚Äôs Hardware[6] and GameSpot.[7] By July 2007, the domain DownloadMoreRam.com[8] was registered, which claims that users can download memory from their site. The download pages do not actually contain files.",
