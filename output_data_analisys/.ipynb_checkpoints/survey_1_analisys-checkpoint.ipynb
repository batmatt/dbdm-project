      "110  Florida Man is a Twitter feed that curates news headline descriptions of bizarre domestic incidents involving a male subject residing in the state of Florida. The tweets are meant to be humorously read as if they were perpetrated by a single individual dubbed “the world’s worst superhero.” In March 2019, a \"Florida Man Challenge\" game began trending across various social media platforms, in which participants shared news headlines taken from search queries for \"Florida Man\" followed by their birthday.   \n",

It is short for the colloquial phrase \"[what] the fuck?\" and typically written without capital letters, spaces and punctuation. Since appearing online in the late 2000s, the slang term has been used in memes, such as image macros, reaction images and a commonly seen one with Snape from Harry Potter reacting in a shocked manner.   \n",

The first image features the set up of the joke with the dog turned to the baby, the second image features the punchline with the dog turned slightly away, while the third is a reaction shot with both the baby and the dog turned to the camera.
